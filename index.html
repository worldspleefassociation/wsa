Hello,and welcome to the WSA - I am working hard to get this website up as soon as possible, but since I am the only one who is working on it, it may take sometime. 
The current WSA crew is thesuperalex, Foofa, and SurpriseGrace. As you can see the team is fairly small and we'd like to expand this to other servers and even try 
different tournaments. If you'd like to help us in anyway contact thesuperalex by skype.
